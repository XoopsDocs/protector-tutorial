## Module Purpose 
 
Protector is a very useful module that can help improve the security of your [XOOPS](http://www.xoops.org)  site, and is widely regarded as a ‘must have’ module for all XOOPS websites. Protector is capable of defending against:
-	Some kinds of denial of service (DOS) attacks, bandwidth-hungry crawlers and spambots.
-	SQL injection, variable contamination, null bytes, session hijacking, and some kinds of cross-site scripting.
-	Brute force attacks and directory traversals.
-	Uploading of camouflaged image files and executables.
-	Link and comment spammers.

Protector logs the attacking IPs and offers a range of countermeasures including IP bans, blank screens and automatic sanitisation of attempted injections etc. Protector also evaluates your site for certain vulnerabilities and providing warnings about them through a ‘security advisory’ page, and provides instructions on how to fix them.
