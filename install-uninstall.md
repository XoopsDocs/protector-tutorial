# Install/Uninstall

The Protector module is a "**must have**" module, and therefore it is included with every XOOPS distribution. 

**It should be installed on every Website powered by XOOPS, as it brings additional security protection and logging capabilities to your site.**

You can install it just like any other XOOPS module from the Admin Control Panel.

Once you have it installed, the suggested procedure for setting up this module is to: 
1. Go to the preferences page and set the module preferences to the recommended state \(see the table below\). It is worth reading through these carefully.  
2.	Visit the ‘Security advisory’ section of Protector's administration area and follow the advice there to eliminate as many of the risks that are identified as you can. Details on how to implement the security fixes are described in the 'Security Advisory' section below.
